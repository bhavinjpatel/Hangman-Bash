# Hangman-Bash

Project Overview:

The Hangman-Bash game was developed to have a
few goals in mind. It is using our groupâ€™s new knowledge of Linux and bash
scripting to create a command line version of Hangman with an intuitive user
experience. 


Features:

The project was initially planned to follow the core functionality of the Hangman game. The synopsis of the game is as follows: 
The player selects a difficulty (easy, medium, hard) and a word will be selected.
Six lives are granted to the player and he or she may guess letters for the
word. Each subsequent wrong guess will decrement the life tally. If the player
guesses all the letters correctly without losing all lives, he or she wins. If
desired, the player may restart the game. Once the player wins, their score
will be recorded and will be available for viewing.
